# Monte Carlo
Using Monte Carlo to approximate pi. I chose to write this in both Python and Java as a fun side project to test which language is fastest at this algorythm.

> In both languages, enter the number (n) of random points you want to use. The more points there are, the more accurate the approximation of pi will be! Both languages return the approximation of pi along with the time it took to get the given approximation. Try it to see which is fastest!
